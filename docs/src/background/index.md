Background Information
=======================
While detailed information on these approaches to discretizing infinite dimensional (or continuous) optimal control problems can be found (and comes from) `this Ph.D. dissertation  <http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0042778/darby_c.pdf>`_, `this related journal publication <http://vdol.mae.ufl.edu/JournalPublications/TOMS-GPOPS-II-August-2013.pdf>`_ and `this technical report <http://systemdesign.illinois.edu/publications/Her15a.pdf>`_, the Background Information section will cover some basics.
